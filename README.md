# Python-Download-Organizer

* Creates a folder on the desktop called "Sorted-Downloads", or uses the folder if it already exists
* Sorts all files downloaded into that folder by extension
* Creates subfolders named after the extension type of any downloaded files, or uses existing folders for extension types if they already exist
* Never have to worry about finding your downloads or sorting through all of them ever again!
